Unix commands:
-------------
 - Unix commands are words (usually) separated by spaces terminated by a
   newline or semicolon (;)  The first word is the "command" name, the words,
   if any, that follow it are it's "arguments", that tell the command what it
   needs to do.

  <command-name> <arguments...>
  - argument words that start with a dash (-) are command line switches.
    ex: -a, -r, etc.
  - Double dash arguments are full word switches, i.e.: --help, --version, etc.

> passwd
  - You will be prompted for your old password then your new password two times.

> chfn
