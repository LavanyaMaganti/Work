- Anonymous functions:
  - These are functions that are created without a name, they can be assigned
    to a variable, so that it has a name.  Often they're just passed to a
    function as a "callback" function a function that the other function uses.
  ex:
  
  var add = function(a, b) { // Note that there is no name following function.
    return a + b;
  }
  // The function is used in the normal way:
  console.log(add(1,2));


Variables and Scope:
===================
- The "scope" of a variable is it's visibility to various areas inside the
  program.
- Variables declared with "var" inside of functions are "local" to the function.
  That is they are only visible or members of the function and don't exist
  outside of the function.  This includes the argument variables.
- Variables declared outside of the function are "global" and are visible inside
  of all functions.

var g = 1;

function foo(a, b) {
  g = a+b;
}
console.log(g);		// prints out 1;
foo(2,3);
console.log(g);		// prints out 5;

<< Talk about functions and variables as business units. >>


Strings:
=======
- Strings as we've seen are lists of characters enclosed in quotes (single or
  double quotes.)

- Each character in the string can be accessed individually by specifying
  the integer index inside of []'s that are appended to the variable name or
  string constant. i.e:
    str[i]
  or:
    'abc'[i]
  The first character in a string is at index 0, the second at index 1, etc.
  If the index is negative or beyond the length of the string the result is
  "undefined", i.e.:
    var str = "abc";
    str[3] == undefined

- The length property gives the number of characters in the string:
  var a = "ten letters";
  console.log(a.length);	// outputs 11.

- Properties can be accessed on string constants:
  "abc".length == 3

- Methods are functions that operate on the variable or constant:
    var a = "one two three";
    a.split(' ');
  or:
    "one two three".split(' ');

  - Makes an array: ["one", "two", "three"] where the string is "split" into
    words separated by the string passed to the split method.

    a.split(""); // Breaks string in a into an array, one character per index.
