Expressions:
===========
- An expression is any mathematical expression that evaluates to some value, the
  result of which may be assigned to a variable or just used directly.
  ex: 1+2, 3-4
- The Mathematical Operators are:
  +	Addition, adds two numbers or concatenates two strings together.
	ex:
	 1+2 -> 3
	 "a" + "b" -> "ab"
	If either side is a string, then both sides are considered strings,
	therefore numbers are converted into strings, then added to the other
	string:
	"a" + 5  -> "a5"
	5 + "5"  -> "55"

  -	Subtraction: a-b = subtraction of b from a.
  *	Multiply: a*b = multiplies a by b
  /	Divide: a/b = divides a by b
  %	Modulus: Remainder from integer division: a%b = remainder from a/b

  Incrementing and decrementing a numeric value by one happens so often in
  programming there is a special operation for it.

  ++	Increment a variable by one.
  --	decrement a variable by one.

  The ++ and -- operations must be associated with a variable:
  var a = 10;	// a is assigned the value 10.
  a++;		// Increments a by one, a now is 11.
  ++a;		// Also increments a by one, a is now 12.

  There is a difference in which side of the variable we use ++/-- on if we want
  the value of the variable.

  var x = ++a;	// Pre-increment: a is incremented, then the new value is given
		// to x.
  var x = a++;	// The value of a is given to x first, then a is incremented.
