  tree <dir>		- Display a indented directory tree.
    ex: tree ~		- Displays a tree of your home directory.

  cd <dir>		- Change directory
    ex: cd	- Changes to your home directory
        cd ~	- Same thing
        cd ..	- Moves to the parent directory
        cd /	- Moves to the root file-system directory.

  cp [-r] <src..> <dst>	- Copy files
    -r = Copy files/directories recursively.
    -a = Preserve permissions and owners, copy file and directories recursively.
    ex:
      cp -r dir1 dir2 ~/dest/	- Recursively copies all of dir1 and dir2 into
				  the directory ~/dest
      cp a.txt b.txt		- Copies a.txt as b.txt
      cp a.txt b.txt c		- Copies text files a and b to directory c.

  mv <src..> <dst>	- Rename / move files, works a lot like cp, but moves
			  instead of copies (think cut-and-paste instead of
			  copy and paste)
    ex: mv a.txt b.txt	- Renames a.txt as b.txt
        mv a b c	- Moves a and b into directory c.

  rm [-r] <file..>	- Remove file or files
    -r = Recursively remove files and directories. DANGEROUS.
    ex: rm a b		- Removes the files a and b.
        rm -r c		- Completely removes the directory c.

  mkdir [-p] <dir..>	- Make a directory
    -p = Make parent directories if they don't exist.

  rmdir <dir..>		- Remove empty directory

- Basic Networking and file copying:
  ssh <user>@<host>     - Secure shell to another computer.
  scp <src> <dst>       - Copy files using ssh
    <src> and <dst> can be one of:
      <path>
      [<user>@]<hostname>:[<path>]	(relative paths are relative to the home
					directory of the remote user account)
    ex: scp a.txt b.txt	 - Copies local files just like cp.
      scp a.txt sbaker@cs.indstate.edu:
        - Copies a.txt to the cs server in sbaker's home directory.
      scp sbaker@cs.indstate.edu:/tmp/x.txt .
        - Copies /tmp/x.txt on the cs server using sbaker's account to our
          current working directory.

  sftp <user>@<host>    - Secure FTP client (interactive, like an ftp client)
  rsync <src> <dst>     - Like scp, but only copies changed files.

- Editors:
  vi/vim/elvis		- Use 'vimtutor' to learn.
  emacs / jove <file>	- Emacs based editors.
  nano/pico <file>	- Includes simple menu at bottom, easy to learn and use.
  ne <file>		- Another easy to use editor, use <esc> for menu.

  kate <file>		- Edit file graphically
  komodo <file>		- Like kate, but lets you display HTML in a sub-window
  atom <file>		- Another graphical editor.
