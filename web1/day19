Break and Continue
==================
- Sometimes we want to exit a loop or do the next loop iteration early, to do
  so we use the break; and continue; statements respectively.

  break [<label>];
   - Exits the loop immediately.  Execution continues at the point following the
     loop.
   - The optional <label> is used to break from a multi-level loop or from 
     within a switch.

  ex:
  var i = 0, s = "A string with more than 10 characters";
  while (true) {
    console.log(i, s[i]);
    if (i++ > 8) break;
  }
  - Prints the first 10 letters of the string in s with its index number and
    stops.

  continue [<continue>];
   - Immediately goes to the expression test part of the loop, skipping any
     remaining statements in the loop.

  /**
   * s = The string to scan.
   * i = Index into the string s;
   * t = A new string which will hold s minus the vowels.
   */
  var i=0, c, s = "The quick brown fox jumped over the fence.";
  var t = "";
  // Set c to the character in s at index i.  If s[i] is null this will stop
  // the loop since the result of the assignment is not true.
  while (c = s[i++]) {
    if (c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u') continue;
    // Not a vowel, so append the character in c to t:
    t += c;
  }
  // Will print what was in s but w/o any vowels:
  console.log(t);
