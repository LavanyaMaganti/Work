Bases continued:
===============

Base 16 (Hexadecimal):
  x = 16
  0 <= a_i <= 15
  We use a-f/A-F to represent the numbers 10-15
  
  FC65 = 15*16^3 + 12*16^2 + 6*16 + 5
         61140   + 3072    + 96   + 5  = 64613

  Powers of 16:
  16^0	1	16^3	4096
  16^1	16	16^4	65536
  16^2	256	16^5	1048576

  - A hex number represents a 4 digit binary number.
  - Often prefixed with a leading 0x to indicate hexadecimal.

- Convert base 8/16 to binary.

Functions
---------
- Functions are an abstraction.  A sequence of code that is given a name, you
  may think of them as mini or sub-programs.

- Functions in JavaScript are defined with the function keyword. Given:

  function foo(a, b) {
    return a+b;
  }

  - "foo" is the name of the function.
  - a and b here are "arguments" or "parameters" to the function.  They are
    variables that hold the values that are passed to the function in the same
    order.  A function may have zero or more arguments separated by commas and
    enclosed in ()'s.

  - The { ... } enclose the "statements" of the function, this is the function
    body.

  - The statement "return a+b;" tells the computer to return the result of a+b
    as this functions "value".  A return with no expression returns no value.

  - This function then would be used like so:

    var v = foo(1, 2);

  - v will be assigned the "return" value of foo, which is the result of adding
    1 (stored in a) and 2 (stored in b) together.

examples:
========
function ma(a, b, c) { return a*b + c; }
var v = ma(1,2,3) + ma(3,4,5);
    v = 5         + 17;
    v = 22

---
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
  console.log("Hello, world!");
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}

- This function just prints "Hello, world!" to the console log 3 times and
  does nothing else.  It does not even return a value.  This kind of function
  is often called a "procedure", it's used to abstract code into simpler to
  understand bite-sized chunks or to eliminate code repetition.  It would be
  used like so:

// Prints out "Hello, world!" 9 times:
hello(); hello(); hello();
