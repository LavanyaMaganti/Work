CS151 Homework #1 (10 pts)

The following are to be done in your CS151 class account.  Use the "man" command
for more information on specific commands.  You may need to use the following
commands: cd, ls, cp, mkdir, chmod, more, less, an editor of some kind and
three new commands called 'grep', 'ln' and 'cat'.

I/O Redirection:
===============
New concept: I/O redirection.  Using the > character followed by a file-name,
we can redirect the output of a command into that file. i.e.:

  ls > output

  The output of the ls command above would be written to the file output
instead of to your screen, over-writing any data that may have already been in
the file.  Use >> file to append to the file rather than over-writing what is
already there. Conversely we can use the < character to read data from a file
into the input of a command, i.e.:

  more < output

would read the file output as the input to more.  This would be like doing:

  ls | more

except we're using a file to store the output of ls.  You will need to use
redirection for some of the problems below.

Grep:
====
Grep is used to search for strings in a file.  These strings may be in the form
of a "regular expression" (often called 'patterns' which are like wild-card
matching of files, but for text.  ^ at the beginning indicates that the string
we're looking for must start at the beginning of the line, so:

  grep ^test file.txt

would search for 'test' at the beginning of a line in the file 'file.txt', but
ignore it if occurs elsewhere in the line.

LABCHECK:
========
You may check your work using the 'labcheck h1' command at your shell prompt to
see how you are doing.  Note that labcheck may not be accurate or give credit
for results that are close enough.  You should not rely of labcheck entirely to
tell you when you have completed the assignment, it is merely a tool to help you
identify problems.

                     === Problem description ===
                     ===========================
Make a directory called h1 in your CS151 accounts' home directory.  Inside
this directory perform the following:

1) Make 5 directories called: a, b, c, d and e. (1/2 pt)

2) Set the permissions on all the 6 directories such that there are no group
   permissions, other permissions are read and search only and user has full
   read/write and search permission. (1/2pt)

3) Using the grep command, search for and use re-direction to store the output
   in the following (5 pts):
   a) Search for the words in /usr/dict/words that contain the sequence 'gho'
      and store the results in 'a/gho.txt' (1 pt)
   b) Search for words in /usr/dict/words beginning with 'ult' and store the
      results in the file 'b/ult.txt'.  Hint:  The ^ character at the
      beginning of a pattern represents the beginning of a line. (1pt)
   c) Search for lines in /etc/hosts that contain '57' and save the output
      in the file 'c/hosts.txt'. (1pt)
   d) Search for the hosts in /etc/hosts that start with 10.0.14 and store
      the results 'd/localnet.txt'. (1pt)
   e) Search for the hosts in 'd/localnet.txt' that contain 'u1' and store
      the results in 'e/u1.txt'. (1pt)

4) Perform the following (1/2pt each / 1.5 pts):
  a) Copy the file 'a/gho.txt' to b/.
  b) Copy the file 'd/localnet.txt' to c/.
  c) Copy the file 'e/u1.txt' to d/.

5) Use the 'ln' command to make the following "symbolic links" (1/2 pt each):
  a) Target the file 'gho.txt' in a with a link name called 'words.txt' in
     the h1 directory.
  b) Target the file 'localnet.txt' in d with a link name called 'local.txt' in
     the h1 directory.
  c) Target the file 'hosts.txt' in c with a link name called 'hosts.txt'
     in the h1 directory.

6) Use the cat command to do the following (1/2 pt each):
  a) Concatenate the two files in c ('hosts.txt' and 'localnet.txt') into the
     file 'c/local'.  Make sure that the data in hosts.txt goes first.
  b) Concatenate 'gho.txt' and 'ult.txt' in the b directory together
     into the file 'words.txt' in the same directory and in that order.

The tree view of h1 (using the 'tree h1' command) should look like this:
h1
|-- a
|   `-- gho.txt
|-- b
|   |-- gho.txt
|   |-- ult.txt
|   `-- words.txt
|-- c
|   |-- hosts.txt
|   |-- local
|   `-- localnet.txt
|-- d
|   |-- localnet.txt
|   `-- u1.txt
|-- e
|   `-- u1.txt
|-- hosts.txt -> c/hosts.txt
|-- local.txt -> d/localnet.txt
`-- words.txt -> a/gho.txt
