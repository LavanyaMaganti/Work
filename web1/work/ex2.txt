CS151 Lab exercise #2 (5 pts)

The following are to be done in your CS151 class account.  Use the "man" command
for more information on specific commands.  You may need to use the following
commands: cd, ls, cp, mkdir, chmod, more, less, and an editor of some kind.

Make a directory called lab2 in your CS151 accounts' home directory.  Inside
this directory perform the following:

1) Make three directories, called a, b and c.  (1/2pt)
2) Make the permissions on a: read/write/search for user, none for group and
   read and search for other.  (1/2pt)
3) Make the permissions on b: read/write/search for user, read and search for
   group and none for other.  (1/2pt)
4) Make the permissions on c: read/write and search (execute) for user, group
   and other.  (1/2pt)

5) Copy the file /u1/junk/cs151/services into a.  (1/2pt)
6) Copy the file /u1/junk/cs151/fstab into b.  (1/2pt)
7) Copy the file /u1/junk/cs151/rgb.txt into c.  (1/2pt)

8) Create a file in lab2 called, numbers, edit the file and place the following
   three numbers, one to a line: (1.5pts)
   b) The first number on the line for "LimeGreen" in the rgb.txt file.  To find
      this number quickly, use the '/' key in more or less to search for a
      string in the file.
   a) The size of the fstab file in bytes.
   c) The number found on the line in /etc/services for 'wizard'.

- You may use the command "labcheck 2" to check your work.  Note this
  auto-checker may not be perfect.  The numbers file should contain no extra
  spaces or lines.

The tree view of lab2 (using the 'tree lab2' command) should look like this:
lab2
|-- a
|   `-- services
|-- b
|   `-- fstab
|-- c
|   `-- rgb.txt
`-- number
