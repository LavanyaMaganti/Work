01-18-2017 (lab session):

Review:
  Notes conventions:
   <x>	= Replace <x> with what x represents.
   [x]	= x is optional.

  > passwd		- Change your password.
  > chfn		- Change your identity information.
  > man <command>	- Read the online manual page on <command>

  > ls [-a] [-l] [--help] [<path>]		- List files
    -a  = List all files, including hidden files: files beginning with a dot (.)
    -l	= Long listing

  > ls -l output decoded:
    -rw-r--r-- 1 user group   283 Jan 13 18:52 file
    |\ /\ /\ / | \        / `File \_________/  `---- Filename
    | U  G  O  |  \______/   Size      `------------ Last modified time
    |  perms   |     `----------------------------- User and Group ownerships
    |          `----------------------------------- Hard link count
    `---------------------------------------------- File type

    U = User permissions (used if the owner is accessing the file)
    G = Group permissions (used if a group owner is accessing a file)
    O = Other permissions (used in all other cases)

  Permissions:
    r = readable
    w = writable / modifiable
    x = Executable (for files) / Search-able (directories, i.e. can 'cd' into)

  File types:
    - = Regular file
    d = Directory
    l = symbolic link

- Basic wild-cards:
  ~		- Your home directory.
  ex:
   cd ~
   cp xy ~/dir/

  ~<user>	- <user>'s home directory

  ex: cp ~sbaker/public_html/cs469/code/xx .

  Note:  pressing the tab key can expand partially typed file-names.  Use tab
    to speed typing of paths.
  
  *		- matches zero or more characters

  ex:		Matches:
  R*		anything beginning with R.
  *.txt		anything ending in .txt

  ?		- Matches any single character

  ex: b???	- Anything starting with b and exactly 4 characters in length.

  [...]		- Like ?, but only matches any of the specified characters.
  [a-z]		- Matches any letter in the range a to z.
  [^...]	- Matches any letter NOT listed.

  ex: cs469[0-9][0-9]	- Starts with cs469 and ends with 2 digits.

- Path length are likely limited to 4096 bytes (depends on file-system)
  /	= root file-system directory
  .	= current directory
  ..	= parent directory
  .*	= "hidden" file (not normally listed unless -a option used.)

- Paths are directories and/or a file separated by forward slashes (/).
  Slashes therefor cannot be in a file-name.

- Path components are separated by forward slashes:
  ex: /etc/rc.d/rc.local
  ex: ../../x/y/z
  ex: /x/../y/. -> /y
