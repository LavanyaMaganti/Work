JavaScript
----------
- What is a programming "Language"?
  - Simply it is a formal (i.e. well-defined) language that is unambiguous at
    all levels.  << Where in English words may have different meaning based on
    context, computers do not handle such ambiguity well. >>
  - The purpose of the language is to instruct the computer, usually when given
    some input, to perform operations on the given input.
  - In that respect a program is like a recipe, ingredients (input) in,
    something to eat out.
  - Computers only understand very simple things at the lowest levels, like:
    - Copy data from one place to another. (assignment)
    - Do numeric operations (such as addition, multiplication) (expressions)
    - compare two values and determine if they are the same or not or if one
      is less or greater than the other. (conditionals, Boolean logic)
    - Jump around from one place to another in the program depending on the
      outcomes of the above comparisons. (loops and functions)
  - Computer languages attempt to abstract the simple things computers do to
    a higher level to make things easier for the programmer.  <<Some languages
    do so better than others.>>

- What is the "syntax" of a computer language?
  - It is the grammar, or rules for the language, just as English does,
    computer languages have similar rules, but much more limited range of
    expression.

- For this class we will learn JavaScript aka ECMAScript.  It is incorporated
  into almost every browser, and also stand-alone as interpreters/compilers
  such as node.js or "node" and SpiderMonkey or "js".

- Demonstrate simple JS hello, world!:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
 <title> Hello, world! </title>
 <meta charset='utf-8'>
</head>
<body>
 <script>
  /**
   * Prints "Hello, world!" to the JavaScript console. Type Ctrl-Shift-i to
   * access the console.
   */
  console.log("Hello, world!");
 </script>
</body>
</html>
---

- "Hello, world!" as a node program:
---
#!/usr/local/bin/node
/**
 * Prints "Hello, world!" to the console.
 */
console.log("Hello, world!");
