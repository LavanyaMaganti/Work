- Go over test2


The "for" loop:
==============
- Many loops have the form:

  <initilize some index variable(s)>
  while (<test expression>) {
    <statements>
    <increment index variable(s)>
  }

  so a specific type of loop was created to handle this form specifically, it
  is the "for" loop:
  
  for(<init expr>; <test expr>; <inc expr>) <statement>
  - All three expressions are optional and may be omitted, however the ;'s
    must remain present. i.e.:
      
    for(;;) <stmt>;	// Will loop forever.

  - <init expr> is only performed once. May declare variables using var inside
    this expression, however these variables are not visible outside of the
    for loop.
  - <test expr> is performed at the beginning of each loop, performing the
    statement only if this is true.  If omitted it is always true.
  - <inc expr> is performed after the statement (or compound statement)
    at the end of each loop.  This is always executed even if a continue is
    raised.
